# SDKWork Commerce Runtime Component Specs

This directory is the local standards index for `@sdkwork/commerce-runtime`.

Root SDKWork standards remain authoritative. Local component specs can narrow or document this component, but they must not contradict [the root standards](../../../../../../../specs/README.md).

## Component

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `@sdkwork/commerce-runtime` |
| Type | `node-package` |
| Root | `sdkwork-commerce/packages/common/commerce/sdkwork-commerce-runtime` |
| Domain | `commerce` |
| Capability | `commerce-runtime` |
| Languages | `typescript` |
| Status | `standard` |

## Contract Manifest

- [component.spec.json](./component.spec.json) is the machine-readable component contract.
- Consumers should integrate through public exports, runtime entrypoints, SDK clients, or adapters declared in the manifest.
- Generated SDK language outputs are represented at their SDK family root instead of duplicating local specs in generated folders.
