# SDKWork Claw Router OpenAI-compatible gateway SDK Component Specs

This directory is the local standards index for `clawrouter-open-sdk`.

Root SDKWork standards remain authoritative. Local component specs can narrow or document this component, but they must not contradict [the root standards](../../../../sdkwork-specs/README.md).

## Component

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `clawrouter-open-sdk` |
| Type | `sdk-family` |
| Root | `sdkwork-clawrouter/sdks/clawrouter-open-sdk` |
| Domain | `platform` |
| Capability | `router` |
| Languages | `csharp, flutter, go, java, kotlin, python, rust, swift, typescript` |
| Status | `standardizing` |

## Contract Manifest

- [component.spec.json](./component.spec.json) is the machine-readable component contract.
- Consumers should integrate through public exports, runtime entrypoints, SDK clients, or adapters declared in the manifest.
- Generated SDK language outputs are represented at their SDK family root instead of duplicating local specs in generated folders.
