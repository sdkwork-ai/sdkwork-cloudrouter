# Repository Guidelines

<!-- SDKWORK-AGENTS-GENERATED: v2 -->

## SDKWORK Soul

Read `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` before executing tasks in this root. Follow specs before memory, dictionary before context, stop on ambiguity, and evidence before completion.

## SDKWORK Standards

Canonical SDKWORK specs path from this root:

- `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/WEB_FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/DATABASE_FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/DRIVE_SPEC.md`

Do not copy root standard text into this repository. If these relative paths do not resolve, stop and report the broken workspace layout.

## Application Identity

Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` when the task touches MCP application behavior, runtime config, SDK wiring, release metadata, app-owned capabilities, packaging, or deployment. MCP persistence uses `ai_mcp_*` tables; file uploads must route through `sdkwork-drive`.

## Local Dictionary Structure

- `AGENTS.md`: repository agent entrypoint and relative SDKWork spec index.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CODEX.md`: compatibility shims that point to `AGENTS.md` and must not duplicate rules.
- `sdkwork.app.config.json`: MCP application identity, runtime, release, and capability metadata.
- `sdkwork.workflow.json`: GitHub packaging/release workflow manifest governed by `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`.
- `.sdkwork/`: repository/application AI workspace metadata, local skills, local plugins, and manifests.
- `specs/`: local application/component contracts and narrowing rules.
- `apis/`, `sdks/`, `crates/`, `database/`: backend contracts and runtime.
- `apps/sdkwork-mcp-pc/`: PC React Hub/Console/Admin client.
- `apps/sdkwork-mcp-h5/`: H5 mobile React client.
- `apps/sdkwork-mcp-flutter-mobile/`: Flutter mobile client.
- `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`: language/build manifests.

## Spec Resolution Order

Use dynamic progressive loading:

1. Read this `AGENTS.md` and any nearer component-level `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` only when app behavior, runtime config, SDK wiring, release, packaging, or app-owned capabilities are touched.
3. Read local `specs/README.md` and `specs/component.spec.json` only when the task touches that local contract.
4. Read local `.sdkwork/README.md`, `.sdkwork/skills/`, and `.sdkwork/plugins/` only when local agent extensions are relevant.
5. Read `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`, then only the task-specific root specs.
6. Inspect implementation files after the dictionary and relevant specs are clear.

Do not load the whole repository or every root spec before identifying the task surface.

## Required Specs By Task Type

- Agent/workflow changes: `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SDKWORK_WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/TEST_SPEC.md`.
- Package script changes: `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/APP_RUNTIME_TOPOLOGY_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/CONFIG_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/TEST_SPEC.md`.
- Any code change: `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`, plus only the touched language/framework spec.
- Rust code: `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md`; add `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_RPC_SPEC.md` when RPC is touched.
- TypeScript/Node code: `../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md`.
- Frontend/UI code: `../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/UI_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, and exactly one detailed UI architecture spec.
- API/SDK changes: `../sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/WEB_FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/WEB_BACKEND_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_WORKSPACE_GENERATION_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/TEST_SPEC.md`.
- Database changes: `../sdkwork-specs/DATABASE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/DATABASE_FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/TEST_SPEC.md`.
- File upload/storage: `../sdkwork-specs/DRIVE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/MEDIA_RESOURCE_SPEC.md`.
- Runtime/deployment/release changes: `../sdkwork-specs/CONFIG_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/ENVIRONMENT_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/DEPLOYMENT_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/RELEASE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SUPPLY_CHAIN_SECURITY_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`.
- Security/auth changes: `../sdkwork-specs/IAM_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/IAM_LOGIN_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SECURITY_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/PRIVACY_SPEC.md`.

Language-specific specs are on-demand; do not load Rust, Java, TypeScript, and frontend specs for unrelated tasks.

## Code Style Rules

Read `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` before code changes. Use `sdkwork-utils-rust` and `@sdkwork/utils` for shared helpers. Generated SDK transport output is changed only through source contracts, generator inputs, or approved composed facades. Do not use `sdkwork-discovery` until RPC services exist.

## Build, Test, and Verification

Use canonical root package scripts from `PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`:

- `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm check`, `pnpm verify`, `pnpm clean`
- `pnpm check:pnpm-script-standard`, `pnpm check:agent-workflow-standard`
- `pnpm api:materialize`, `pnpm sdk:generate`
- `cargo test --workspace`

Run the narrowest relevant check first, then broader verification when API contracts, SDK generation, persistence, security, packaging, or cross-package boundaries change.

## Agent Execution Rules

Use the convention dictionary before broad source loading. Follow dynamic progressive loading: nearest AGENTS, relevant manifests/specs, task-specific root standards, then implementation. Do not replace generated SDK integration with raw HTTP in production surfaces. All file uploads must integrate through `sdkwork-drive`. Record exact verification commands and important outputs before reporting completion.

## Human Review Rules

Request human review before breaking SDKWork standards, changing public naming, altering security/auth behavior, changing database migrations or production deployment config, deleting data/files, changing generated SDK ownership, or modifying release/deployment governance. Surface unresolved spec paths, app identity conflicts, component ownership conflicts, and API authority ambiguity instead of guessing.
